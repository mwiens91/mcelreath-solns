\section*{2. Display costs}

When considering the Hawk-Dove game in Chapter 2, Doves were able to
``display'' at no cost, and hence their payoff matrix was given by

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    & Hawk & Dove \\
    \hline
    Hawk & $(v - c) / 2$ & $v$ \\
    Dove & $0$ & $v / 2$ \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now let's add a cost to displaying, $d$, where $0 \leq d \leq v$. Hence
the modified payoff matrix is given by

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    & Hawk & Dove \\
    \hline
    Hawk & $(v - c) / 2$ & $v$ \\
    Dove & $0$ & $v / 2 - d$ \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that when $d = 0$ the modified payoff matrix reduces to the
original payoff matrix; and that when $d > v / 2$, two Doves in an
interaction over a resource incur a net loss interaction.

Following the methods in the textbook, let's show that neither Dove nor
Hawk is an ESS by considering what happens when a rare Hawk invades a
Dove population and what happens when a rare Dove invades a Hawk
population.

\textbf{Hawk invasion}

In a population of Doves, the fitness of a Dove is given by

\begin{equation*}
    W(D) \approx w_0 + \frac{v}{2} - d
\end{equation*}

and the fitness of a rare Hawk is given by

\begin{equation*}
    W(H) \approx w_0 + v
\end{equation*}

Hawks can invade a population of Doves if

\begin{align*}
    &W(H) > W(D) \\
    &\Rightarrow w_0 + v > w_0 + \frac{v}{2} - d \\
    &\Rightarrow \frac{v}{2} > - d
\end{align*}

which is always satisfied since $d > 0$ and $v > 0$. Hence Dove is not
an ESS.

\textbf{Dove invasion}

In a population of Hawks, the fitness of a Hawk is given by

\begin{equation*}
    W(H) \approx w_0 + \frac{v - c}{2}
\end{equation*}

and the fitness of a rare Dove is given by

\begin{equation*}
    W(D) \approx w_0
\end{equation*}

Doves can invade a population of Hawks if

\begin{align*}
    &W(D) > W(H) \\
    &\Rightarrow w_0 > w_0 + \frac{v - c}{2} \\
    &\Rightarrow c > v
\end{align*}

Thus when the cost of fighting over a resource is greater than the value
given by that resource, Doves can invade Hawks and Hawk is not an ESS.

\textbf{Mixed equilibrium}

Suppose there is a stable equilibrium population of Doves and Hawks.
